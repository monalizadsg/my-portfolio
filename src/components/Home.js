        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          I'm a self-taught developer. I started learning HTML, CSS and
          Javascript. And now, I'm currently learning React. I'm very passionate
          about learning and coding has been playing a huge part of my daily
          life for the past few months. I'm self-driven person who enjoys
          building apps and websites, and I quickly learn by doing which took me
          out of my comfort zone.
        </p>
        <p>
          I'm fascinated with technology as there is so much to learn new things
          every day. Along my learning journey, I was able to train myself
          consistently and pushing my own limits to discover ways how to solve a
          problem. I firmly believe that practice is the key to become better at
          something. I always enjoy learning new things and coding keeps me
          uncomfortable but it is the only way to learn and grow.
